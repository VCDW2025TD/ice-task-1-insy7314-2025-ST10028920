SSL/TLS are cryptographic protocols that secure data in transit; “SSL” is the older term while modern secure connections actually use TLS. HTTPS (HTTP over TLS) provides server authentication, confidentiality (encryption), and integrity (tamper detection), making it far more secure than plain HTTP. Without TLS, attackers can eavesdrop, steal cookies/tokens, inject scripts (MITM), or alter responses in transit. Real-world incidents have included data leaks and SSL-strip attacks where users were silently downgraded to HTTP, exposing credentials and sessions. In development, self-signed certificates enable local HTTPS testing, but production must use certificates from a trusted CA and correct server configuration (HSTS, secure ciphers, proper chain).
